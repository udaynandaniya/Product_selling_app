Product Selling App is an innovative web-based project developed as part of an IoT-integrated solution. It combines a front-end interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with an emergency alerting IoT device. This app enables users to view and explore products while showcasing integration with an emergency alert system â€” ideal for situations such as road accidents or urgent help scenarios.
The website features a dynamic and visually appealing UI with background effects and interactive components. It also makes use of Local Storage to retain relevant user data or preferences across sessions. The layout includes multiple blocks representing different functionalities, such as product views, emergency features, and navigation to related pages like Home, Contact, and Blog.
The highlight of this system is the IoT-based emergency alerting device. This hardware prototype is designed to detect emergencies and immediately trigger alerts. Information from the device can be linked with this app interface to notify users, display alerts, or initiate a rescue process. The app can be used in real-world scenarios like vehicle safety systems or personal protection tools.
